    - Full-text search on job titles and skills.
    - Filtering by location, experience level, job type, and source platform.
    - Efficient, server-side pagination.
- **Secure User Authentication:** Full authentication flow (register, login) using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** and **bcrypt.js** for password hashing.
- **Protected Routes:** Middleware to secure user-specific endpoints, such as bookmarking jobs.
- **Professional Error Handling:** Centralized error handling with custom `ApiError` and `ApiResponse` classes for consistent and predictable responses.
- **Containerized & Deployable:** Fully containerized with **Docker** and includes a **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments to **AWS ECS**. Also configured for deployment on **Render**.
