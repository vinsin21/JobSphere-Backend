// **What we did here:**
// * **Separated Logic:** Notice this file doesn't know anything about `express` directly. It just imports the configured `app` from `app.js`.
// * **Loaded Environment:** It uses `dotenv` to load your `.env` file so we can access `process.env.PORT`.
// * **Robust Startup:** It attempts to connect to the database *first*. If the database connection fails (which we'll build next), the server won't even try to start. This prevents errors where your app is running but can't talk to its data.
